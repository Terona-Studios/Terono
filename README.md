## Install

| You use Discord… | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| **on Windows** | Download **[Terono-Setup.exe](https://github.com/Terona-Studios/Terono/releases/latest/download/Terono-Setup.exe)** and double-click it. If Windows says *"Windows protected your PC"*: **More info → Run anyway** (the file isn't code-signed yet). Discord restarts with Terono. |
| **on macOS or Linux** | Open a terminal and run the command below. Discord restarts with Terono. |
| **in a browser** (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, Firefox) | Download **[Terono-Chromium.zip](https://github.com/Terona-Studios/Terono/releases/latest/download/Terono-Chromium.zip)** (Firefox: **[Terono-Firefox.zip](https://github.com/Terona-Studios/Terono/releases/latest/download/Terono-Firefox.zip)**), unzip it, open your extensions page, turn on **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked** and pick the folder. Switch off the normal Vencord extension if you have it. |
| **with just a theme** (Vencord, BetterDiscord) | See [Theme only](#theme-only) below. |

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Terona-Studios/Terono/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open the Terono settings: **Ctrl + 1**, the Terono icon next to the ← → arrows, or **Settings → Vencord → Plugins → Terono**.

New to this? The **[step-by-step tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md)** walks through installing, every setting, updating and uninstalling.

<details>
<summary>What the installer does</summary>

It installs Git and Node.js if they're missing (Windows via winget, macOS via Homebrew), builds Vencord with Terono in a `Terono` folder in your home folder, adds it to Discord and turns Terono on. Your Vencord settings, themes and plugins stay. Vencord only runs extra plugins from a copy built on your own PC; the installer does that for you. The Windows installer is open source ([installer/](installer/)) and logs to `%TEMP%\Terono-Setup.log`.
</details>

## Updating

Nothing to do: Terono updates itself in the background when Discord starts and asks if you want to restart now. You can also click **Check for updates** at the top of the Terono settings. Browser: download the new zip.

## What you get

**Look**
- 11 **presets** with live preview, then change anything.
- Colors: primary, text, icons, status, window buttons and an **app border** (color, gradient or your own picture).
- Cards: dark, gray, white or your own color or gradient; sharp to round corners; solid, **glass** or **liquid glass**; a picture or video inside them.
- Embeds in their own color, gradient or glass. Background: animated, static, solid, picture, GIF or video.
- 22 fonts shown in their own style, or your own font. Your own home logo and your own pictures for Discord's icons.

**Layout**
- Server list left, top, bottom or right; channels and members on either side.
- Channel header: name, buttons and search anywhere; hide any button.
- Messages: yours on the right and others on the left, or the other way round.

**Calls & streams** *(early alpha in 1.0.8.1: expect bugs)*
- People as circles with a wave when they talk; streamers get a **LIVE** ring, click to watch.
- Watch up to 4 streams at once: side by side, one big + two, or 2 × 2; click one to focus it. The others in a side column. **Ambient mode** glow.
- Minimized stream in any shape (rounded, sharp, pill, circle…), dropped anywhere on screen. **Terono**, **Discord** or **Custom** style.

**Tools** *(bulk mode, AFK and the overlay are early alpha in 1.0.8.1)*
- **Search** every setting and plugin from one box.
- **Plugins:** every Vencord plugin by category, switched on and off instantly.
- **Bulk mode:** hold Ctrl and click servers, DMs or friends, then right-click one: everything in Discord's menu is done to all of them. Double-click Home to read everything.
- **AFK in calls:** one click mutes and deafens you and shows your message and when you're back to everyone with Terono.
- **Terono overlay:** over your games: who's in your call and who's talking, DMs and mentions as they come in. A hotkey makes it clickable: mute, deafen, leave, open a message.
- **Badges:** the **Terono OG** badge for everyone on 1.0.5 – 1.1.5, up to 3 badges of your own, and Discord's badges. Seen by everyone with Terono, updated instantly.
- **Profiles:** save looks, switch between them, share them as files.
- Auto-translate, chat bar and right-click menu cleanup, role count styles, Terono loading screens.

**Light on your PC**
- Moving effects update 30 times a second instead of at your monitor's full refresh rate and stop completely while Discord is in the background. **Performance mode** for slower PCs.

## Presets

Settings → Terono → **Presets**: **Preview** tries one on your own Discord, **Apply** keeps it (with or without its layout).

## Theme only

Just the look, without the plugin's settings and tools:

- **Vencord:** Settings → Vencord → Themes → **Online Themes**, paste this link and save:
  ```
  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Terona-Studios/Terono@main/theme/Terono.theme.css
  ```
- **BetterDiscord:** put [Terono.theme.css](https://github.com/Terona-Studios/Terono/releases/latest/download/Terono.theme.css) in your BetterDiscord `themes` folder.

## Found a bug?

Report it on the Terona Studios Discord: **[teronastudios.com/discord](https://teronastudios.com/discord)** (also linked at the top of the Terono settings). Add **Extras → Troubleshooting → Copy debug info** and a screenshot; it shows your versions and what Terono found, so it can be fixed fast.

## Privacy

Terono only talks to these services, for the features that use them:

- **Terono badge server** (Cloudflare): the list of badges and who's AFK. Only your Discord user ID and what you set yourself; signing in once lets only you change your badges.
- **Google Translate:** only with *Auto-translate* on (off by default).
- **Google Fonts:** fonts other than Discord's own.
- **GitHub / jsDelivr:** updates and preset pictures.
- **DuckDuckGo:** website icons for "domain" connections on profiles.

Your uploaded logos, fonts, backgrounds and icon pictures stay on your PC.
